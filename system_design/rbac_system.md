# Role-Based Access Control System (RBAC System)

Basically, it uses **roles** to make people **access** certain stuff.

## Benefits

- A single **role**, multiple **permissions**.

- One **permission**, multiple or single **resource** to access.

- User can have *multiple* **roles**, which makes it easier to **manage** what they can **access**, instead of giving them all the **permissions** at once and leaving room for mistakes.

- You can also **track** and log people's activity based on their **roles**.
