# Docker

**Docker** lets you put your **app** and everything it **needs** *(like libraries and settings)* into a small **package** called a **container**. This makes it easy to **run** your **app** on any **computer** without worrying about things breaking.

This uses **technology** called **containerizing**, basically only running the **software** of an *OS*.

While [Virtual Machines](../hosting/vm.md) *(VM)* needs **hardware** to be configured and then installs the **software** *(OS)*.
