# Python

A **scripting** language that has an **interpreter** which reads the file and **executes** it in one thread.

**Python**, by default, is a **single-thread** program. It doesn't have **thread-safe** data types for 
*lists* or *dicts* and creating an actual thread is a **separate process** that will be handled by the 
**OS** *(Operating System)*. A simple way to use it for quick **automation** tasks or small **servers** 
*(small enough without the need for a lot of resources)*.

**Python 3** - The latest version so far.
**Python 2** - Is way different from **Python 3** both in way of working and syntax.
**Python 1** - Believe it or not. It is the first version of that language.
