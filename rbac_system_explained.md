# Role-Based Access Control System (RBAC System)

Basically it uses roles to make people access certain stuff.

## Benefits

- If you have a large system, where there are so many resources and services. 
Then you need a easy way to manage and give access to people to these resources.
The best way so far is by roles. Each role has it's own permission, so that you 
don't have to give each permission over again to users, but just give them that single 
role and they will have all the permissions needed to access all things that they want.
Also this minimizes the chance of giving the wrong permissions or forgetting to give all
the permissions to that users.

- A single role, multiple permissions.

- User can have multiple roles, which makes it easier to manage what they can access, instead of giving them all the permissions at once and leaving room for mistakes.

- You can also track and log people's activity based on their roles.
