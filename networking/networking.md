# Networking devices and protocols

# Devices

## Router

## Switch

It has **connected devices** to the **switch** by **cables**. When a **device** sends **data** to another, the **switch** sends it only to the **receiver** and not to **everyone**.

## Hub

Different **devices** connected by **cables** to the **hub**. When one **device** sends **data** to another, the **hub** sends it to **all devices**.

## Access Point

Provides **Wi-Fi** for **devices** to use.

# Protocols

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

The **user device** is given an **IPv4** or **IPv6** address from the **switch** or **router**. 

This is how the **router**/**switch** knows where each **device** is located. For this it also uses the **MAC (Media Access Control)** address.
