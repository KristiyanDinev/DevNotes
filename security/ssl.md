# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)
**SSL/TLS** are protocols used to secure communications over networks, especially the **Internet**.
**TLS** is the more secure successor to **SSL** and is used in modern systems.

**Example**: HTTPS websites use **SSL/TLS** to secure browser-server communication using *certificates* from a trusted CA *(Certificate Authorities)*.
