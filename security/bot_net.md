# Bot net

A network of devices connected to a master server, which controls them all.

## Implementation

Such an example you can look at any server management tool, which provides a way for you to 
add a server to monitor it and maybe to deploy an application on it.

Examples:

- **Kubernetes** - manages docker containers and also can deploy them on multiple servers.

- **Portainer** - tool that is deployed in a docker container and it manages containers. Just as easy to use UI for management.

In these examples you have a tool or software that manages multiple applications, which can be in multiple servers, 
but it is one main tool/software and that software may have access restrictions, such as users and admins.
The same things is in the bot nets, but the difference is that in hacker's bot net is more like execute a command to hurt something, but in development is more like a deploy an application on multiple servers for performance and availability sake. Yea. Just the intentions are different.

*But some people just steal the devices and hack into them, so they can be part of their own network of devices.*
