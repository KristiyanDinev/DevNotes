# How to take notes

It is important to take notes in a way that they will be understandable by the reader and writer.

**NOTE:**

- *information* - The actual data that you hear or read. The data which you receive.

- *knowledge* - The complete understanding of the data you receive by hearing it or reading it.

## School or Collage / University

### Structure
I think the best way to structure your notes is by making them like a plan.

These are simple steps to go over when taking notes.

**Steps:**
1. Introduction

2. New Information

3. Connecting the new information with old information (if possible)

4. Summary

#### Introduction

Of course, we need to know what we are recording and what subject we are looking into these notes.

#### New Information

This new information involves having a plan that explains the new information.
What I mean by plan is like:

```
Mathematics

1. Geometry

2. Theory

3. Formulas

4. Examples

etc.
```

Try to explain the new information with as many detail as you can. 
So, if you have the desire to go back and see the subject in-depth, you can do so, 
and like that you have recorded the in-depth with your own words, so it might be more 
understandable, so you won't forget it and then relearn it again. 

Give examples if you can. Try to give as many examples of different scenarios as possible, so that you may find a pattern and understand it better.

#### Connecting the new information with an old information

If you can't make any connections or examples with something that you already know of, then you can skip this part. You may also compare the old information (or the thing you could connect the new information with) with the new information which you are now learning about. This can help you identify new information more easily and therefore learn it faster and hopefully better. 

Better is to make the plan simpler, than to think about how you could explain something you don't know about.

#### Summary

Must be written using your own words and thoughts. No AI. No people's opinion, but yours alone should be there.

Make sure you don't rush it, since you will look at the summary of the class/lecture more often, then the whole plan. Take your time to write meaningful notes that will explain the subject, even with examples, to make it easier for understanding. Make sure that you write stuff that you understand.

This part is important to be simple and understandable for even people who will read about this subject and don't know anything about it.

## Documentaries

Normally, there will be tools that will generate the documentary, based on their configurations and usage, but I think it is also good to know how to write clean documentaries. Whether it be for IT or other jobs which require to record some rules or functionalities.

### Writing documentaries manually

You could a similar pattern of writing these notes.

For example:

**Java**
```
Package com.company.sql

Class SQL

Inherits com.company2.sql

- It runs sql queries.

methods:

run(String query) - Runs the query.

build() - Returns a sql builder.

preparedStatement() - Returns a prepared statement.


Details:

run(String query)

- Runs the query.

- Throws an Exception, when failed.

- Returns SQLResult for select queries.

build() 

- Used to build the query.

- Throws no exceptions.

- Returns a sql builder.

preparedStatement()

- Used to prepare a sql statement.

- Throws no exceptions.

- Returns a prepared statement.
```

### Tools

- Swimm

- Automatically generated Javadoc in IntelliJ IDEA (Main Menu -> Tools -> Generate Javadoc...) 
**This generation requires you to actually put some notes in your classes in your source code.**

- Doxygen

- GitHub Wiki (not automatic)
