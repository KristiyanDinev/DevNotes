# How to take notes

It is important to take notes in a way that it will be understandable by the reader and writer.

**NOTE:**

- *information* - The actual data that you hear or read. The data which you receive.

- *knowledge* - The complete understanding of that data you receive by hearing it or reading it.

## School or Collage / University

### Structure
I think the best way to structure your notes is by making it like a plan.

These are simple steps to go over, when taking notes.

**Steps:**
1. Introduction

2. New Information

3. Connecting the new information with an old information (if possible)

4. Summary

#### Introduction

Of course we need to know what we are recording and what subject are we looking into these notes.

#### New Information

This new information involves having a plan that explains the new information.

Try to explain the new information with as much details as you can.
So if you have the desire to go back and see the subject in-depth, you can do so, 
and like that you have recorded the in-depth with your own words, so it might be more 
understandable, so you won't forget it and then relearn it again.

Give examples if you can. Try to give as much examples for different scenarios as possible, 
so that you may find a pattern and understand it better.

#### Connecting the new information with an old information

If you can't make any connections or examples with something that you already know of, then you can skip this part.
You may also compare the old information (or the thing you could connect the new information with.) with the 
new information, which you now learn about. This can help you identify the new information more easily and therefore 
learn it faster and hopefully better.

Better it is to make the plan simpler, than to think  about how you could explain something you don't know about.

#### Summary

Must be written by using your own words and thoughts. No AI. No people's opinion, but yours alone should be there.


## Documentaries

Normally there will be tools that will generate the documentary, based on their configurations and usage, 
but I think it is also good to know how to write clean documentaries. Whether it be for IT or other jobs 
which require to record some rules or functionalities.
