# DevNotes
I want to share what (as a developer) have experienced and may have learned.

This may contain the problems I have seen and the solutions to them (if any)

and it contains some explanations as theory or "good to know" explanations.

### Good to know before reading
- This mainly uses `Java` as a programming language for examples or explanations.
- Not all of the explanation and examples are from me, but I have put cross-references and quotes from another peoples' answers.
