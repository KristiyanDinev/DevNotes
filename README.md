# DevNotes
I want to share what (as a developer) have experienced and may have learned.

This may contain the problems I have seen and the solutions to them (if any)

and it contains some explanations as theory or "good to know" explanations.

Why do I make them in markdown language? Because normally the documentations that are stored in files are in 

`.md` which is markdown language. And there are free online converters that can convert the markdown language

to a HTML website and from there a PDF or even a word document if you really need it.

**Tip**

If you want to see what uses what or to go to the definition of a class or interface or annotation, then you can use 

hold Ctrl and hover over the name of the component and it will become clickable, and then click it. The mouse may not always show 

the hand cursor, but it will direct you to the definition, then you can select the name of the class or field or method and right 

click on it then Go To -> Implementations. This will show you all the classes that use this component you selected in their 

definition. I am using IntelliJ IDEA, but it should be something similar to the other IDEs.

### Good to know before reading
- This mainly uses `Java` as a programming language for examples or explanations.
- Not all of the explanation and examples are from me, but I have put cross-references and quotes from another peoples' answers.
- Some of the problems in LeetCode are in `algorithms` folder with an interesting solution that may make you think out of the box.
