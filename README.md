# DevNotes
I want to share what (as a developer) have experienced and may have learned.

This may contain the problems I have seen and the solutions to them (if any)

and it contains some explanations as theory or "good to know" explanations.

Why do I make them in markdown language? Because normally the documentations that are stored in files are in 

`.md` which is markdown language. And there are free online converters that can convert the markdown language
to a HTML website and from there a PDF or even a word document if you really need it.

### Good to know before reading
- This mainly uses `Java` and `C#` as a programming language for examples or explanations.

- Not all of the explanation and examples are from me, but I have used quotes from another people or bots' answers.

- Some of the problems in LeetCode are in `algorithms` folder with an interesting solution that may make you think out of the box.
