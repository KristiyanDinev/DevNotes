# Overview of Key IT Concepts and Technologies

## ERP/EAI Systems & EDI Protocols

### ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
**ERP systems** integrate key business processes (like **finance**, **supply chain**, **HR**) into one system.

**Example**: SAP, Oracle ERP Cloud

### EAI (Enterprise Application Integration)
**EAI** enables seamless data exchange and workflow between **disparate applications** within an organization.

### EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)
**EDI** automates the exchange of business documents in a **standard format** between partners.

### Common EDI Protocols:
- **AS2**: Transfers data securely over HTTP/S with **encryption** and **digital signatures**.
- **OFTP2**: Used in the **automotive industry** for secure data transfers.
- **X.400**: A **robust messaging system** mainly used by governments and large enterprises.
- **S/FTP**: Combines **FTP** with **SSH** to ensure secure file transfers.

#### Why is EDI important?
It reduces **manual processing**, eliminates **paperwork**, and improves **transaction speed** and **accuracy**.

## SSL & PKI

### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)
**SSL/TLS** are protocols used to secure communications over networks, especially the **Internet**.

### PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
A **PKI** manages digital keys and **certificates** to authenticate and secure communication.

#### Components of PKI:
- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Issues digital certificates.
- **Digital Certificate**: Verifies identity using cryptography.
- **Public/Private Keys**: Used for **encryption** and **decryption**.

**Example**: HTTPS websites use SSL/TLS to secure browser-server communication using certificates from a trusted CA.

#### What's the difference between SSL and TLS?
**TLS** is the more secure successor to **SSL** and is used in modern systems.
